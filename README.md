# Fruit-classifier
This project builds a fruit image classification system using CNNs with a ResNet architecture. Trained on the Fruits 360 dataset (90,000+ images), the model learns visual patterns effectively and achieves 99% accuracy, serving as a strong introduction to deep learning and computer vision.
